Repository for our first boot camp project.

Our Kobushi app (the name of a flower in Japan) is an anime search engine that can help a user discover and learn a little bit about anime videos. From here you can view a trailer on Youtube, if one is available. You can also search online for the DVD to purchase. 

It uses the API for an anime website called Jikan. It is implemented with Bootstrap and javascript, including the jQuery and jQueryUI libraries. We used jQueryUI to implement an autocompleting search bar that populates it's options from a list kept on firebase.
